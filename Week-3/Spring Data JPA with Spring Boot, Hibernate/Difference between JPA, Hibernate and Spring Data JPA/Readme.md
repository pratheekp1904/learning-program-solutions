Understanding JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA
This document explains the differences between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA, and how they relate to one another in Java persistence architecture.

üìå JPA (Java Persistence API)
JPA is a Java specification (JSR 338) for object-relational mapping (ORM).
It provides a standard API for persisting Java objects to relational databases.
JPA defines interfaces and annotations but does not provide any implementation.
It acts as a blueprint that can be implemented by different providers such as Hibernate, EclipseLink, OpenJPA, etc.

üîß Hibernate
Hibernate is an ORM tool and the most widely used implementation of the JPA specification.
It provides concrete classes and features to persist data using JPA.
In addition to JPA capabilities, Hibernate includes its own powerful features such as:
*Caching
*Lazy loading
*HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
*Advanced mappings

üöÄ Spring Data JPA
Spring Data JPA is not an implementation of JPA.
Instead, it is a higher-level abstraction built by Spring on top of a JPA provider like Hibernate.
It focuses on minimizing boilerplate code needed for data access layers.
Features include:
*Auto-implementation of repository interfaces
*Pagination and sorting
*Query methods using method names
*Integration with Spring‚Äôs transaction management
